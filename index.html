        <h3>ABOUT THE GAME</h3>
        Welcome to the page that will forever change the way you type. This website has a game
         (which you should totally check out, by the way) which is pretty cool and was actually
         made in about 4 or 5 days. (Amazing, isn't it?) To play the game, you'll have to click
         the tab on the side that says "Go To Game". But first, here's an intro to the game. The
         game is for those who want to improve their typing skills. It will feature bubbles
         that pop up on the screen that contain letters. You'll have to type that letter (or
         set of letters) to get a score. You get points for correct answers and deductions for
         incorrect typing. The best part about this is that you won't be able to look at your
         keyboard to have a high score. (Sorry, but that's the way you properly type.) After x
         amount of seconds, the game will end and your score will be totaled. High scores will
         be featured on the scoreboard.
